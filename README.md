# About me

I am a **computational physicist** specializing in **Soft Matter Physics**, currently pursuing a **PhD** at the **School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology (CCEB)**, **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**.

During my **Masterâ€™s in Nanotechnology**, I investigated the anisotropic regime in *Artificial Colloidal Ice*, a model to study the effects of geometrical frustration at larger and more accessible spatial and temporal scales.

I enjoy solving physical problems through code, with a focus on clarity, maintainability, and performance. While most of my projects are for personal or research use, I strive to follow decent practices.

I am a Linux and FOSS enthusiast who values understanding systems deeply and improving them where possible. I enjoy configuring efficient workflows, automating tasks, experimenting with new tools, and refining my setup to balance flexibility, and efficiency.

I also enjoy teaching, as it allows me to share knowledge, support others in their learning, and refine my own understanding. Whether mentoring students, discussing research, or writing about technical topics, I aim to explain concepts clearly and make them accessible.
