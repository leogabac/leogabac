# About me

I'm a computational physicist with a focus on soft matter physics, particularly artificial colloidal ice. In am currently doing a Master's degree in Nanotechnology at Tecnológico de Monterrey. I enjoy solving physical problems through code and strive for clean, and performance—though my projects are mostly for personal/research use.

I'm a computer, linux and FOSS enthusiast who enjoys understanding how things work and making them better. I use Arch (btw). I like tweaking my setup, finding ways to work more efficiently, and re-invent the wheel from time to time. I enjoy experimenting with different tools, writing scripts to automate tasks, and embracing the philosophy that computing should be efficient, flexible, and, above all, enjoyable.

I also enjoy teaching, as it allows me to share knowledge and help others grow. Explaining complex ideas in a simple way is both a challenge and a reward, and I find it fulfilling to see others gain confidence in what they’re learning. Whether it’s mentoring students, discussing research, or writing about technical topics, I like breaking things down and making them easier to understand. Teaching also helps me learn, as it pushes me to think more clearly and explore new perspectives.
