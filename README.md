ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a Master's student at TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey, specializing in *Nanotechnology*. My research focuses on *Soft Matter Physics*, particularly in *Artificial Colloidal Ice*. Iâ€™m passionate about using simulations to explore the fascinating properties of colloidal systems and how they can be engineered for future technologies.

You can reach my by sending an email to leogabac@proton.me

## Outside of Research
When I'm not running simulations, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring Linux systems, delving into the latest in tech, or indulging in my other interests, like music, science, and anime. I also enjoy writing and sharing my thoughts on these topics through my blog.
