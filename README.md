# About me

I am a **theoretical/computatioal physicist** specializing in **Computational Soft Matter Physics**, currently pursuing a **PhD** at the **School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology (CCEB)**, **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**.

During my **Master’s in Nanotechnology**, I researched the anisotropic regime in *Artificial Colloidal Ice*, a model to study the effects of geometrical frustration at larger and more accessible spatial and temporal scales.

I enjoy solving physical problems through code, with a focus on clarity, maintainability, and performance. While most of my projects are for personal or research use, I strive to follow decent practices.

I am a Linux and FOSS enthusiast who values understanding systems deeply and improving them where possible.

From time to time I make projects to automate or solve specific aspects of my workflow, in other works, I reinvent the wheel anytime I forget I can google solutions. Here is a list to some of them:

- [leovim](https://github.com/leogabac/leovim): My `neovim` configuration. Ready to use with Python, C/C++, LaTeX, and any other tool I use at the time.
- [gremux](https://github.com/leogabac/gremux): A tmux session manager
- [suisave](https://github.com/leogabac/suisave): A simple text-configured backup tool.
- [hakodocs](https://leogabac.github.io/hakodocs/home): My personal wiki. A collection of "How to do _X_" guides I compiled over the years.
- [Random Access Thoughts](https://leogabac.github.io/RandomAccessThoughts/): My blog.

I also enjoy teaching, as it allows me to share knowledge, support others in their learning, and refine my own understanding. Whether mentoring students, discussing research, or writing about technical topics, I aim to explain concepts clearly and make them accessible.
